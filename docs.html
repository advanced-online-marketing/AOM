<h2 class="title text-center">Matamo AOM Plugin Documentation</h2>
<p>Integrate additional data like campaign names, ad impressions, costs etc. from advertising platforms (such as
    Google AdWords, Microsoft Bing, Criteo, Facebook Ads and Taboola) and individual campaigns (such as cost per
    view/click/acquisition and fixed price per months deals) into Matamo and combine that data with individual visits -
    <strong>create a whole bunch of new opportunities!</strong></p>

<!-- Advertiser's platforms -->
<h2 class="sub-title text-center">Importing and merging advertiser's platforms' data</h2>
<p>To obtain data (campaign names, costs, ad impressions, etc.) from the advertising platforms, API access must be
    granted and configured within the settings of this plugin.</p>

<p>To map individual visits with the data from the advertising platforms, all links from the platforms must have
    <a href="advertisers-platforms.html">additional params</a> that supply mapping-related data like campaign and ad IDs
    to the Matamo AOM plugin. This data is stored in the database columns <code>log_visit.aom_platform</code> and
    <code>log_visit.aom_ad_params</code>. When a visitor returns with other tracking params, a new visit is started
    automatically.</p>

<p>After you have set up a cronjob <code>./console aom:process</code> that gets executed every minute a copy of every
    single Matamo visit is written (and conversions are added) to <code>aom_visits</code>.</p>

<p>After you have set up <a href="http://piwik.org/docs/setup-auto-archiving/">auto archiving</a> the following two
    tasks will be executed by AOM:</p>

<h4 class="sub-title">1. Import data from advertising platforms</h4>
<p>Imported data is stored in the database table <code>aom_{platformName}</code>. Every advertising platform's data is
    aggregated on a daily basis in the timezone of the advertising platform's account. Merged data will only be correct,
    when your website's timezone matches the timezones of each advertising platform account.</p>

<h4 class="sub-title">2. Merge imported data with individual visits</h4>
<p>The background job iterates over all imported advertising platform data and updates the visits in the
    <code>aom_visits</code> table with that data. If no real Matamo visits match the advertising platform's data, an
    artificial visit is being created in the <code>aom_visits</code> table to make sure that all cost is allocated.</p>

<p>The data in <code>aom_visits</code> contains both all Matamo visits and all costs. It is used in the marketing
    performance report in the Matamo UI and it can be used via the <a href="api.html">API endpoints provided by the Matamo
    AOM plugin</a> (e.g. for further processing in a data warehouse).</p>

<p>Whenever a visit is added to or updated in the <code>aom_visits</code> table, an
    <code>AOM.aomVisitAddedOrUpdated</code> event is posted. You can listen to that event within your separate plugin
    to integrate Matamo AOM in your <strong>event oriented architecture</strong> (e.g. to publish those events to
    external systems or message brokers).</p>


<h3 class="sub-title text-center">Manual importing, merging & visit reprocessing</h3>
<p>You can (re)import data manually by executing <code>./console aom:import --platform={platformName}
    --startDate=YYYY-MM-DD --endDate=YYYY-MM-DD</code>. Reimporting data deletes all previously imported data for the
    given platform and period, but it does not delete any data in <code>aom_visits</code> (it only adds and updates to
    that table). Adding <code>--merge=true</code> merges the newly imported data immediately after the import has
    finished.</p>

<p>You can merge imported data manually by executing <code>./console aom:merge --platform={platformName}
    --startDate=YYYY-MM-DD --endDate=YYYY-MM-DD</code>.

<h3 class="sub-title text-center">Logging</h3>
<p>The log file can be set in <code>config.ini.php</code> in section <code>AOM</code> with parameter <code>log_file</code>.

</p>


<!-- Requirements, installation & updates -->
<h2 class="sub-title text-center">Requirements, installation &amp; updates</h2>

<p>MySQL 5.0.3 or higher is required as we store more than 255 characters in VARCHAR. As we use MySQL multi row inserts
    and updates for a better performance make sure that your
    <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/packet-too-large.html"><code>max_allowed_packet</code> size is high
    enough (this roughly depends on how much visits you have).</p>

<p>You must be able to run cron jobs to set up both
    <a href="http://piwik.org/docs/setup-auto-archiving/">auto archiving</a> and the background job <code>./console
    aom:process</code> (execution of the latter every minute) that updates visits and conversions in the
    <code>aom_visits</code> table.</p>

<p>You can install the Matamo AOM plugin from the <a href="https://plugins.matomo.org/AOM?matomoversion=3">Matamo marketplace</a>.</p>

<p>Set up <a href="http://piwik.org/docs/setup-auto-archiving/">auto archiving</a> to automatically import and merge
    data from the advertiser's platforms. The auto archiving cron job executes the <code>core:archive command</code>
    which triggers <a href="https://developer.piwik.org/api-reference/Piwik/TaskScheduler">Matamo's TaskScheduler</a> and
    thus this plugin's tasks (see <code>Tasks.php</code>). You can trigger all of this plugin's background jobs manually
    by executing <code>./console core:run-scheduled-tasks --force</code>.</p>

<p>Merging will only be correct, when your website's timezone matches the timezones of each advertising platform
    account.</p>

<p>Add the params that are required to assign imported data to individual visits to all links managed in the advertising
    platforms as described <a href="advertisers-platforms.html">here</a>.</p>


<!-- Limitations -->
<h2 class="sub-title text-center">Limitations</h2>

<h3>Advertising platforms</h3>
<p>All data is being processed on a daily basis, i.e. variations of click costs during the day are not being
    considered.</p>

<h4>Google AdWords</h4>
<p>Visits of Google display network are assigned on AdGroup level.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>This plugin has successfully been tested with up to 25k visitors a day for a period of more than two years, running
    on an AWS server with 4 GB RAM and a separate AWS RDS MySQL database. Single PHP processes might use up to 1 GB RAM
    and run for minutes. You might encounter performance issues during importing, merging, accessing the plugin's
    marketing performance report in the UI or using the plugin's API when you have more traffic or a an infrastructure
    with less performance.
