<h2 class="title text-center">Tracking params, importing and merging</h2>
<p>Here you'll find all the information about how to set up the tracking params that enable the plugin to assign
    imported platform data to individual visits.</p>

<p>Make sure that you have understood and followed the <a href="docs.html">introduction</a> before adding params.</p>

<h2 class="sub-title text-center">Google AdWords</h2>

<h3>Tracking params</h3>

<p>Since July 2017 the only supported way for Google AdWords is to use
    <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1733663">auto-tagging</a>, which
    automatically adds a parameter named <code>gclid</code> to all links coming from AdWords. With the help of AdWords'
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/reports/click-performance-report">click performance
    report</a> we can identify campaign, ad group etc. for every single AdWords click afterwards.</p>

<p>When a Google AdWords ad for which you enabled auto-tagging is clicked, data like the following can be found in
    <code>log_visit.aom_ad_params</code>:</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <pre><code class="language-php">{
    "platform":"AdWords",
    "gclid":"CICO-Krt9c4CFSQz0wodCNUH8Q"
}</code></pre></div>


<!-- Google AdWords: Importing & merging -->
<h3>Importing &amp; merging</h3>

<p>For importing and merging you must activate AdWords and provide API credentials within this plugin's settings. This
    requires a <a href="https://code.google.com/apis/console#access">web application in the Google API console</a> with
    Matamo's full URI (e.g.
    <a href="http://local.matamo.de?module=AOM&amp;action=platformAction&amp;platform=AdWords&amp;method=processOAuthRedirect">http://local.matamo.de?module=AOM&amp;action=platformAction&amp;platform=AdWords&amp;method=processOAuthRedirect</a>)
    being an authorized redirect URI.</p>

<p>AdWords data is being (re)imported for the last 3 days (as old data might change). At first a
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/appendix/reports/click-performance-report">click performance
    report</a> will be fetched to identify campaign, ad group etc. for every single AdWords click (gclid). Afterwards,
    the usual merge process is going to happen.</p>


<!-- Microsoft Bing Ads -->
<h2 class="sub-title text-center">Microsoft Bing Ads</h2>

<h3>Tracking params</h3>

<p>We use <a href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/apex/index/3/en-us/51091">URL tracking</a> to obtain the required

<!-- Individual campaigns -->
<h2 class="sub-title text-center">Individual campaigns</h2>

<p>For some campaigns, such as email marketing partnerships or CPA deals, there might not be an advertising platform
    with an API, where you can fetch the additional data (like campaign names and cost) from. Therefore Matamo AOM allows
    you to provide this data and Matamo AOM distributes the costs to the visits that resulted from the campaign (even if
    there were no visits the costs are still being considered). Here are some examples:</p>

<h4>Email marketing campaign</h4>

<p>Imagine you've created an email marketing campaign to advertise a special christmas deal which cost you $ 1000 and
    that you are going to send out on December 1st 2017. From previous email marketing campaigns you know that about 95%
    of visits occur within the first week after the email has been send out. You have added the
    <a href="https://matamo.org/docs/tracking-campaigns/#tracking-campaigns-using-url-parameters" target="_blank">
    tracking parameter</a> <code>pk_campaign=Email-December-2017</code>.</p>

<p>Now, in Matamo AOM you would simply create an individual campaign before December 1st with the following data:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
    <th>Begin of campaign</th>
    <th>End of campaign</th>
    <th>Campaign name</th>
    <th>Params</th>
    <th>Referrer</th>
    <th>Total cost in website currency</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
    <td>2017-12-01</td>
    <td>2017-12-07</td>
    <td>E-Mail special christmas deal 2017</td>
    <td>pk_campaign=Email-December-2017</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>1000</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<h4>Partnership with your friends-famous-website.com</h4>

<p>Your friend offered you to place a link to your website for the whole month of December 2017 within one of his
    magazine articles which is hosted at friends-famous-website.com/article-4711.html. As he does not want to add
    any tracking params (and his visitors don't like obvious advertising), you can only identify traffic coming from him
    by the referrer. You agreed to pay 10 Cents per article visit. In January 2018 he informs you that there have been
    5,000 visits, thus you create ex post - in January 2018 - the following individual campaign:</p>

<table><thead>
<tr>
    <th>Begin of campaign</th>
    <th>End of campaign</th>
    <th>Campaign name</th>
    <th>Params</th>
    <th>Referrer</th>
    <th>Total cost in website currency</th>
</tr>
</thead><tbody>
<tr>
    <td>2017-12-01</td>
    <td>2017-12-31</td>
    <td>Partnership friends-famous-website.com Dec. 2017</td>
    <td></td>
    <td>friends-famous-website.com/article-4711.html</td>
    <td>500</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>As soon as you add individual campaigns like these to Matamo AOM, Matamo AOM first distributes the cost you provided
    equally over all days within the campaign duration which you provided. Within these days, cost is equally
    distributed between visits.</p>

<p>You cannot distribute costs to visits that have been detected by Matamo AOM, i.e. you cannot distribute (additional)
    cost for example to an AdWords campaign that already got additional data from AdWords. Matamo AOM takes care of that,
    but <strong>you need to make sure that your specifications don't overlap</strong>, e.g. that you distribute the cost
    of two email marketing campaigns to the same pool of visits.</p>


<!-- Individual campaigns: Offline campaigns -->
<h3>What about offline campaigns such as TV advertising, radio spots or offline magazines?</h3>

<p>The problem with offline campaigns like TV advertising is that you can neither detect from the HTTP referrer nor
    from the params that the visitor came from a specific TV spot. He might have also read about your brand in an
    offline magazine or got a recommendation from a friend. Nonetheless, there are ways to track TV advertising and the
    similar - but this is a topic on our future roadmap!</p>


<!-- Other advertising platforms and Matamo's default tracking params -->
<h2 class="sub-title text-center">Other advertising platforms and Matamo's default tracking params</h2>

<p>You should not use any of the params listed above when the advertising platform you are using is not listed here.</p>

<p>Matamo's <a href="http://matamo.org/docs/tracking-campaigns/">default tracking params</a> <code>pk_campaign</code> and
    <code>pk_kwd</code> (or the tracking params provided by the
    <a href="https://plugins.matamo.org/MarketingCampaignsReporting">Marketing Campaigns Reporting plugin</a>) should
    be used for both supported and unsupported advertising platforms.</p>
